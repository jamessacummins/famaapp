edging towards a change in Economic Management","We must be in a recession because I\u2019m getting a lot more letters from readers telling me they\u2019ve figured out how to fix the economy in a way the economists haven\u2019t been smart enough to discover.","https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1211364644/960x0.jpg?fit=scale",["We must be in a recession because I\u2019m getting a lot more letters from readers telling me they\u2019ve figured out how to fix the economy in a way the economists haven\u2019t been smart enough to discover. Their solutions can be weird and wonderful, but a lot of them boil down to a simple proposition: if the economy\u2019s in recession and unemployment\u2019s high because people aren\u2019t spending enough money, why doesn\u2019t the government just print a lot of money and spend it itself?","But here\u2019s the scoop: the idea that, rather than borrowing to fund their budget deficits \u2013 thus incurring big debts and interest bills \u2013 governments should just create the money they need has been anathema to economists for the past 40 years, but this may be changing. There is a growing debate among economists, between the proponents of what they call \u201cmodern monetary theory\u201d and more conventional economists and econocrats over whether governments should just create the money they need.","The defenders of the conventional wisdom have had to concede a lot of ground. Whereas a decade ago MMT was lightly dismissed as a crackpot idea, as this radical idea has gained more attention its opponents have had to admit it would be perfectly possible to do. They just think it would be a really bad thing to do. Trick is, the \u201cunconventional policy\u201d of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d \u2013 where the central bank buys second-hand government bonds and other securities and pays for them merely by crediting the seller\u2019s bank account \u2013 is quite similar to what the radicals are seeking.","All the major advanced economies \u2013 the US, the Eurozone, Britain and Japan - began doing this in big licks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, once their official interest rates were so close to zero that they could be pushed no lower. And now, once this coronacession had prompted our Reserve Bank to drop our official rate to its \u201ceffective lower bound\u201d of 0.25 per cent in March, it too has resorted to quantitative easing, promising to buy as many second-hand bonds as necessary to keep the interest rate on three-year government bonds no higher than 0.25 per cent.","So, how exactly would what the Reserve is already doing be very different to what the MMT advocates say it should be doing?","The greatest proponent of MMT is an Australian, Professor Bill Mitchell, from my alma mater, the University of Newcastle. Internationally, its highest profile salesperson is Professor Stephanie Kelton, of Stony Brook University in New York, author of the big-selling The Deficit Myth.","Our leading commentator on the debate is Dr Stephen Grenville, a former deputy governor of the Reserve. And our most vocal opponent of MMT is present Reserve governor Dr Philip Lowe.","Those opponents are right to say there\u2019s nothing new about \u201cmodern\u201d monetary policy. In the days before the loss of faith in simple Keynesianism, it was common for governments to fund their budgets partly by selling bonds to the Reserve Bank, rather than to the public.","So the fatwah on governments \u201cprinting money\u201d dates back only as far as Milton Friedman and his monetarists\u2019 semi-successful attack on Keynesian orthodoxy in the late 1970s, when all the developed economies had a big problem with high inflation. Friedman argued that inflation was \u201calways and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\u201d which governments could control by limiting the supply of money. Governments eventually realised that the quantity of money was \u201cdemand-determined\u201d and that setting targets for growth in the money supply didn\u2019t work. They switched to using the manipulation of interest rates to target the inflation rate.","As sensible economists always knew, it was never true that creating money always leads to greater inflation. It does so only when the demand for \u201creal resources\u201d \u2013 land, labour and physical capital \u2013 exceeds the supply of real resources. Only then do you have \u201ctoo much money chasing too few goods\u201d.","This has been confirmed by the failure of all the money created by quantitative easing since the global financial crisis to cause much, if any inflation, contrary to the predictions of the world\u2019s few remaining monetarists.","The opponents are also right to say, quoting Friedman\u2019s most famous aphorism, that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch and it\u2019s a delusion to imagine MMT offers one.","As Lowe argued vigorously at his appearance before the Parliament\u2019s economics committee earlier this month, in reply to questions from Greens leader Adam Bandt, it may seem that by creating money rather than borrowing it you\u2019re avoiding a lot of debt and interest payments but, in reality, all you\u2019re doing is delaying and hiding the bill to the government and its taxpayers.","It\u2019s also a delusion (as the leading proponents of MMT acknowledge) that governments would be free to create (or \u201cprint\u201d, to use a misleading metaphor) as much money as they needed, without restraint. The restraint is the same one it always was: the limited supply of real resources.","While ever the demand for real resources \u2013 the things we use to produce goods and services \u2013 is falling short of the supply of those resources, creating money should lead to increased demand for them (provided you do it more effectively than the big central banks did it after the financial crisis).","But once demand was growing faster than the supply of real resources, any further money you created would simply cause inflation. This is what\u2019s really worrying the opponents of MMT (and me). If you let the politicians off the leash to spend as much as they liked up to a point, how would you ever get them to stop once that point was reached?","While ever all we\u2019re doing is quantitative easing, the independent central banks do the deciding, not the politicians. Which brings us to Lowe\u2019s \u201cadvanced negotiating position\u201d: why risk letting the pollies start creating money when the government can borrow from the public at interest rates that are pathetically low. And Lowe\u2019s promising to keep them low for as long as necessary."],"Ross Gittins","12:04pm 24th of August 2020"],["INTERNATIONAL NEWS","Definite shift' in Border Force approach to travel ban as approvals surge","The Australian Border Force is approving travel requests at a much higher rate now than earlier in the pandemic and making decisions within hours that previously took weeks.","https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_13%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/adcfc6fe4b3a9276f1858d6af1347b9a8bb161f8"],["GADGETS","Elon Musk unveils brain computer implanted in pigs","Just when you thought the year 2020 couldn't get much weirder, billionaire Elon Musk has introduced a group of pigs with mind-reading brain implants.","https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.14682173174872665%2C$multiply_0.254%2C$ratio_1%2C$width_378%2C$x_0%2C$y_99/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/9eac226fad1ce3d7afd5e7c9fc8381d29e040b03"],["OPINION/CHINA-RELATIONS","The Andrews-Morrison bromance is heading for an ugly break-up","The window of convenience that saw a working relationship blossom during COVID-19 is coming to a tragic end.","https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3%2C$multiply_0.254%2C$ratio_1%2C$width_378%2C$x_79%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/b5ee7fbde675a678e1bde60c8fdf288a4e01ac77"],["CONSUMER SPENDING","Household savings climb as Aussies hunker down for recession","Households are using the pandemic year to build their nest eggs and gird against recession, with savings and investments trending higher since the start of 2020.","https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.149%2C$multiply_0.254%2C$ratio_1%2C$width_378%2C$x_201%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/3497f0f06334e12f61fc72c10fbab16e3fa07ef0"],["ROAD SAFETY","Sydney slows down as state government pushes for lower speed limits","Motorists will be forced to slow down in more areas of Sydney as speed limits are lowered to improve road safety.","https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1542%2C$multiply_0.4%2C$ratio_1%2C$width_200%2C$x_86%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/fb20175a07015f5d10280efc06455c5ef7e599cc"]]},e}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e;return 0===this.state.page?e=o.a.createElement(u,{updatePageToFeed:this.updatePageToFeed}):1===this.state.page?e=[o.a.createElement(f,{articles:this.state.articles,updatePageToArticle:this.updatePageToArticle}),o.a.createElement(N,{updatePageToSearch:this.updatePageToSearch,updatePageToFeed:this.updatePageToFeed,updatePageToSettings:this.updatePageToSettings})]:2===this.state.page?e=[o.a.createElement(y,{updatePageToLogin:this.updatePageToLogin}),o.a.createElement(N,{updatePageToSearch:this.updatePageToSearch,updatePageToFeed:this.updatePageToFeed,updatePageToSettings:this.updatePageToSettings})]:3===this.state.page?e=[o.a.createElement(b,null),o.a.createElement(N,{updatePageToSearch:this.updatePageToSearch,updatePageToFeed:this.updatePageToFeed,updatePageToSettings:this.updatePageToSettings})]:4===this.state.page?e=[o.a.createElement(E,null),o.a.createElement(N,{updatePageToSearch:this.updatePageToSearch,updatePageToFeed:this.updatePageToFeed,updatePageToSettings:this.updatePageToSettings})]:5===this.state.page?e=[o.a.createElement(A,{articles:this.state.articles,updatePageToSub:this.updatePageToSub}),o.a.createElement(N,{updatePageToSearch:this.updatePageToSearch,updatePageToFeed:this.updatePageToFeed,updatePageToSettings:this.updatePageToSettings})]:6===this.state.page&&(e=[o.a.createElement(C,{articles:this.state.articles}),o.a.createElement(N,{updatePageToSearch:this.updatePageToSearch,updatePageToFeed:this.updatePageToFeed,updatePageToSettings:this.updatePageToSettings})]),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},e)}}]),a}(o.a.Component);i.a.render(o.a.createElement(o.a.StrictMode,null,o.a.createElement(k,null)),document.getElementById("root"))}],[[11,1,2]]]);
